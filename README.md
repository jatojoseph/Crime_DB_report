## Crime DataBase Report with Postgress
The goal of this guided project is to setup a postgres database from scratch and load the Boston crime csv data into it, 
create two user groups: Readonly Users: with the permission to read data only and Readwrite Users: with permissions to read and alter
data but not to delete tables.
